Learning Objectives
This project aims at showing use cases where a DevOps mindset is bringing value to a software project by automating it, which decreases the amount of manual work and increases the development speed. It focuses on why automation is useful and helps speeding a development lifecycle.

After this project, you should be able to:

Understand the value of automating tedious tasks
Define a development lifecycle
Automate shell-like tasks with Make, and/or shell script
Be aware of tools dependencies and the value of reproducing environment
Build static HTML website from Markdown code using Go-Hugo
Prerequisites
Concepts
You should have a basic knowledge of the following concepts:

Shell terminal basics, using command lines:

Navigating in a Unix file-system
Understanding how stdin/stdout redirection and piping
Showing and searching the content of a text files
Defining and using Environment Variables
Adding command lines to your terminal using the apt-get package manager and/or with the PATH variable
Writing and executing a shell script
Git with the command line (and also a graphical interface)

Retrieving or creating a repository
Manipulating changes locally with Git’s 3 steps process (workspace, staging, history)
Distributing changes history with remotes repositories
Make/Makefile usage:

Executing tasks through make targets
Default target and PHONY target
Makefile’s variables and macro syntax
Tooling
This project needs the following tools / services:

An HTML5-compliant web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, etc.)
A free account on GitHub, referenced as <GitHub Handle>
A shell terminal with bash, zsh or ksh, including the standard Unix toolset (ls, cd, etc.) with:
GNU Make in version 3.81+
Git (command line) in version 2+
Go Hugo v0.80+
The student needs to be able to spawn up a clean Ubuntu 18.04 system. Therefore Docker is recommended with NO prior knowledge.
A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Editor) of your convenience (Visual Code, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ, etc.)
